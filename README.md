Electric Bike
11. Scope / Objectives of the project:
❖ Sustainable Transportation: Innovative Zero-Emission Electric Bikes:
To develop an electric bike that benefits the environment by emitting zero tailpipe 
emissions, reducing air pollution, and combating climate change. They are more 
energy-efficient than traditional vehicles. Assuming the energy needed to power this 
drive is generated from a clean source.
❖ Advanced Control for Extended Battery Life, Range and Temperature:
Our primary goal in developing a sophisticated control system to improve electric bike 
efficiency is to extend battery life and improve overall range. We aim to maximize 
energy efficiency through innovative engineering, making electric bikes more reliable 
and practical for daily use.
❖ To develop a mild regenerative system to extend the life of the battery.
Developing an innovative approach, we aim to utilize regenerative braking to power 
auxiliary systems on the electric bike. This not only enhances energy efficiency but also 
contributes to a more sustainable and self-sufficient riding experience.
❖ To attain self-stability which maintains the bike in a perfect balance.
Our goal is to introduce a novel self-stability feature that ensures the electric bike 
always maintains perfect balance. This advancement not only improves safety but also 
provides riders with an unrivaled and effortless riding experience.
❖ To enhance the safety of EV by adding multiple redundancy protocols.
We are implementing multiple redundancy protocols to strengthen the security of 
electric vehicles as part of our commitment to safety. This approach ensures a
